- Resolution: 1920×1080 at 30fps; keep the VS Code window and the diagram slide visible simultaneously.
- Font size: 16pt+ for both terminal and code editor.
- Windows: show the slide/whiteboard with the orchestrator diagram, the code in the editor, and the terminal output from `collaboration_patterns.py`.
- Commands: run `clear`, then `bash run.sh` while describing each orchestration step. Pause at each handshake to highlight the context stack.
- Visual cues: point to the JSON data snippet when talking about collaboration patterns, and overlay arrows showing the orchestrator handing off to agents.
