# Collaboration patterns helper

`collaboration_patterns.py` prints the orchestrator flow, the agents involved, and how conversational context is preserved between them.

## Ejecutar

```bash
python collaboration_patterns.py
```

The script reads `data/collaboration_patterns.json` and narrates the three core patterns (role assignment, task delegation, conversational handoffs) as seen on the slides.
