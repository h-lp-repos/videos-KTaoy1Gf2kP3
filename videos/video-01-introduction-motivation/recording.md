# Recording instructions — Video 1

- Resolution: 1920×1080 at 30fps; prefer a widescreen layout with the slide deck on the left and terminal on the right.
- Terminal font: 16pt or larger with a high-contrast theme (Solarized dark or similar) for readability of the example script output.
- Windows to show: terminal + slide deck (diagram comparing single-agent vs multi-agent). Keep the script output visible while narrating.
- Commands to prep: run `clear` before recording and ensure `python --version` reports 3.9+.
- Cues: highlight the diagram when explaining specialization, then shift to the terminal when running `python code/motivation_overview.py` (zoom in briefly on the console output).
- Visual cues: show the checklist on screen while quoting the checkpoint lines, and mention the two references at the end of the clip.
