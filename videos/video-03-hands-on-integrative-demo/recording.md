# Recording instructions — Video 3

- Resolution: 1920×1080 at 30fps with a split layout showing the terminal, VS Code editor, and the workflow diagram simultaneously. Keep the font size at 16pt or larger.
- Windows: show the diagram of the orchestrator, HR, and Tech agents in one pane, the script open in VS Code in another, and the terminal where `python code/query_router.py --demo` is running.
- Commands: run `clear`, then `bash run.sh`. During the conversation context section, pause to highlight the history lines printed beneath the demo output.
- Visual cues: zoom into log lines showing which agent responded to each query, and overlay arrows when explaining conversational handoffs.
