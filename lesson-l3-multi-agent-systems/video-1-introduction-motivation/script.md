# Script: Video 1 – Introduction & Motivation

## [00:00–00:30] Opening
- Welcome viewers.
- Contextualize the lesson within the AI Engineering program’s progression.

## [00:30–02:00] Motivation
- Discuss limitations of single-agent systems (bottlenecks, lack of specialization).
- Introduce practical scenario: AI assistant routing HR and Technical queries to specialized agents.

## [02:00–03:30] What Are Multi-Agent Systems?
- Define multi-agent systems as architectures with multiple collaborating intelligent agents.
- Emphasize distributed intelligence, modular design, and scalability benefits.
- Present diagram contrasting single-agent vs. multi-agent architectures.

## [03:30–05:00] Why Now? Industry Trends and Applications
- Highlight industry applications (customer support automation, workflow orchestration).
- Explain growing need for specialization and collaboration in AI systems.

## [05:00–06:00] Learning Objectives
- Outline student takeaways:
  - Recognize architectural distinctions.
  - Understand collaboration patterns.
  - Implement multi-agent workflows with LangChain and OpenAI function calling.
- Preview structure and flow of forthcoming lessons.

## Checkpoints
- “If you can explain why single-agent systems face challenges with diverse queries, you’re ready to proceed.”
