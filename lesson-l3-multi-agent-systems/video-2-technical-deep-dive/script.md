# Script: Video 2 – Technical Deep-Dive

## [00:00–01:00] Recap: Single-Agent Architecture
- Show diagram of a typical single-agent workflow.
- Discuss centralized logic and limitations.

## [01:00–03:00] Multi-Agent Architecture
- Diagram of Orchestrator routing to specialized agents.
- Benefits of distributed reasoning, modularity, scalability.

## [03:00–05:30] Collaboration Patterns Overview
- Define Role Assignment, Task Delegation, Conversational Handoffs.
- Annotated workflow diagrams.

## [05:30–09:00] Code Snippets: Collaboration Patterns in Practice
- Python examples for role definitions, delegation functions, context passing.

## [09:00–12:00] Live Coding: Building a Simple Multi-Agent Workflow
- Stepwise build: define agents, routing logic, context preservation.

## [12:00–13:00] Wrap-Up and Transition
- Summarize takeaways.
- Preview upcoming hands-on demo.

## Checkpoints
- “If you can sketch the user query flow through the Orchestrator and specialized agents, you’re ready.”
- “If you grasp conversational context maintenance, you’re ready for implementation.”
